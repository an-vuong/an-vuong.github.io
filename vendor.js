 JS Beautifier

  Originally converted to javascript by Vital, <vital76@gmail.com>
  "End braces on own line" added by Chris J. Shull, <chrisjshull@gmail.com>
  Parsing improvements for brace-less statements by Liam Newman <bitwiseman@gmail.com>


  Usage:
    js_beautify(js_source_text);
    js_beautify(js_source_text, options);

  The options are:
    indent_size (default 4)          - indentation size,
    indent_char (default space)      - character to indent with,
    preserve_newlines (default true) - whether existing line breaks should be preserved,
    max_preserve_newlines (default unlimited) - maximum number of line breaks to be preserved in one chunk,

    jslint_happy (default false) - if true, then jslint-stricter mode is enforced.

            jslint_happy        !jslint_happy
            ---------------------------------
            function ()         function()

            switch () {         switch() {
            case 1:               case 1:
              break;                break;
            }                   }

    space_after_anon_function (default false) - should the space before an anonymous function's parens be added, "function()" vs "function ()",
          NOTE: This option is overriden by jslint_happy (i.e. if jslint_happy is true, space_after_anon_function is true by design)

    brace_style (default "collapse") - "collapse" | "expand" | "end-expand" | "none" | any of the former + ",preserve-inline"
            put braces on the same line as control statements (default), or put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style), or just put end braces on own line, or attempt to keep them where they are.
            preserve-inline will try to preserve inline blocks of curly braces

    space_before_conditional (default true) - should the space before conditional statement be added, "if(true)" vs "if (true)",

    unescape_strings (default false) - should printable characters in strings encoded in \xNN notation be unescaped, "example" vs "\x65\x78\x61\x6d\x70\x6c\x65"

    wrap_line_length (default unlimited) - lines should wrap at next opportunity after this number of characters.
          NOTE: This is not a hard limit. Lines will continue until a point where a newline would
                be preserved if it were present.

    end_with_newline (default false)  - end output with a newline


    e.g

    js_beautify(js_source_text, {
      'indent_size': 1,
      'indent_char': '\t'
    });

// document. Line objects hold arrays (markedSpans) containing
// {from, to, marker} object pointing to such marker objects, and
// indicating that such a marker is present on that line. Multiple
// lines may point to the same marker when it spans across lines.
// The spans will have null for their from/to properties when the
// marker continues beyond the start/end of the line. Markers have
// links back to the lines they currently touch.

// Collapsed markers have unique ids, in order to be able to order
// them, which is needed for uniquely determining an outer marker
// when they overlap (they may nest, but not partially overlap).
